# This file describes access control rules for controller actions, and
# is provided as a way to prevent you scattering such rules across your
# various controllers using +verify+ and method-specific logic.
# 
# In development mode, these rules are reloaded with every request, but
# in production the rules are only loaded once and held in memory.

Consent.rules do
  
  # Add your access control rules here. See
  # vendor/plugins/consent/README for examples.
